## What Is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform specific tasks.  
Since computers cannot understand human languages, programming languages like Python are used as intermediaries.

---

## Compiler vs Interpreter

- **Compiler**: Translates the entire program into machine code before execution.  
- **Interpreter**: Translates and executes the program line-by-line.

Python uses an interpreter.

---

## Python Basics

- Python syntax and character sets  
- Keywords and identifiers  
- Comments (single-line and multi-line)  
- Basic input and output functions

---

## Variables and Data Types

- Variables as containers for data  
- Rules for valid identifiers  
- Common data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`

---

## Operators

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`  
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  
- Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.  
- Logical: `and`, `or`, `not`

---

## Control Flow Statements

- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- Nested conditions and decision making

---

## Strings, Lists, and Tuples

- String operations: concatenation, indexing, slicing  
- Lists: mutable ordered collections  
- Tuples: immutable ordered collections  
- Examples of common methods and operations

---

## Input and Output

- Taking user input with `input()`  
- Converting input data types

---

## Comments and Code Structure

- Importance of comments for readability  
- Single-line and multi-line comments

---

## How to Use

- Read through the notes to understand Python basics  
- Experiment with provided code snippets in your Python environment  
- Modify and practice examples to deepen your understanding
