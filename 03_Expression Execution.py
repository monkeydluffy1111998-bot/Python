# #String & String can operate with +

# #A,B = 2,3
# #Txt = "@"
# #print((A+Txt)*B)

# Numeric values can operate with all arithmetic operators.

# A,B = 2, 5.0
# C = 4
# print(A+B*C)

#Result of division operator with two integer will be float

# A,B = 1,2
# C = A/B
# print(C)

#Integer (//) division with float and int will give int display as float 

# A,B = 1.5, 3
# C = A//B
# print(C, A/B)
